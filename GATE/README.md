# Using Latex:
This shows a tiny usage of latex programming language where there is content and a simple circuit diagram.
LaTeX (pronounced <b> "LAY-tech" </b> or <b> "LAH-tech" </b>) is not a programming language per se but a typesetting system commonly used for the production of technical and scientific documents. 
It is based on the TeX typesetting system, which was developed by Donald Knuth. 
LaTeX provides a set of macros and commands that simplify the process of formatting and typesetting documents, especially those containing complex mathematical equations, scientific notations, and references.
## Here are key points about LaTeX:
<pre>
    <b>1)Typesetting Documents:</b> LaTeX excels at typesetting high-quality documents, particularly those with mathematical and scientific content. It is widely used in academia, research, and publishing for the production of articles, reports, theses, and books.

    <b>2)Markup Language:</b> LaTeX documents are written using a markup language, where the content is described with plain text along with markup commands. Users focus on the content structure, and LaTeX takes care of formatting, making it particularly useful for large and complex documents.

    <b>3)Cross-Platform Compatibility:</b> LaTeX documents are plain text and can be edited with any text editor. LaTeX distributions are available for various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
    
    <b>4)Scientific and Academic Usage:</b> LaTeX is widely used in the scientific and academic communities because of its ability to handle complex mathematical notation and its support for the BibTeX system for managing bibliographies.

    <b>5)Templates and Styles:</b> LaTeX allows users to create and use templates, defining the document structure and style. This makes it easy to maintain a consistent look and feel across documents and publications.

    <b>6)Collaborative Writing:</b> LaTeX is conducive to collaborative writing, as the source files can be easily shared and edited using version control systems like Git. This is beneficial for large writing projects involving multiple authors.

    <b>7)Customization:</b> Users have a high degree of control over the layout and formatting of documents through the use of packages and customization options.
